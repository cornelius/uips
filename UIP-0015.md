## Abstract
This UIP introduces the concept of _remote staking_ which allows users to
delegate staking to other nodes which can stake their funds but can not spend
them. The mechanism is similar to the
[cold staking in Particl](https://particl.wiki/staking#cold_staking) and to the
[account leasing in NXT](https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/Account_Leasing).

## Motivation
The Proof-of-Stake protocol requires users to keep their wallets (usually with
a significant amounts of money) online to propose and validate blocks. If
a computer with the staking wallet gets hacked then the attacker will be able
to steal the money.

Another potential problem is that public keys get revealed during the process of
staking. It makes wallets vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Obviously,
those kinds of attacks are purely theoretical at the moment.

## Specification
Remote staking is enabled by a special kind of unlocking script which requires
different keys for staking and spending transactions.

The segwit remote-staking `scriptPubKey` consists of 1-byte push opcode `OP_1`
followed by two data pushes of 20 and 32 bytes:

```
1 <20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash> <32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash>
```

Where data pushes correspond to the following hashes:
1. `<20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash>` is a HASH160 of a public key for staking
   (i.e. `RIPEMD160(SHA256(compressed pubkey))`);
2. `<32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash>` is a SHA256 of a public key for spending.

The witness MUST be validated in the same way as it is validated for P2WPKH (as
specified in
[BIP-141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#witness-program))
except for the validation of a public key hash:
* The witness MUST consist of exactly 2 items (â‰¤ 520 bytes each). The first one
  a signature, and the second one a public key.
* The validation of a public key hash depends on the type of transaction which
  spends the output with the remote-staking `scriptPubKey`:
  * when the transaction is a coinbase transaction (`TxType::COINBASE`) then
    HASH160 of the public key MUST match the `<20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash>`,
  * otherwise the SHA256 of the public key MUST match
    `<32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash>`.
* The signature is verified against the public key with CHECKSIG operation. The
  verification MUST result in a single TRUE on the stack.

The following is an example of a version 1 remote staking `scriptPubKey` and
corresponding witness and `scriptSig`.
```
  witness:      <signature> <pubkey>
  scriptSig:    (empty)
  scriptPubKey: 1 <20-byte-staking-key-hash> <32-byte-spending-key-hash>
                (0x0114{20-byte-staking-key-hash}20{32-byte-spending-key-hash})
```

The usage of 256-bit destinations (SHA256 of a public key) SHOULD be hidden from
the users (more about it in the rationale section). Hence, _we do not need to
introduce new 256-bit address format_.

### Transaction Signature Verification
[BIP-143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki)
specifies the transaction digest algorithm for version 0 witness programs.
According to it, the transaction digest algorithm looks as follows:

```
  Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
     1. nVersion of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
     2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
     3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
     4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
     5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
     6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
     7. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)
     8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
     9. nLocktime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
    10. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)
```

For version 1 witness program the algorithm is the same as specified in BIP-143
except for the fifth field `scriptCode` value of which depends on the type of
the transaction:
* if the transaction is a coinbase transaction then `scriptCode` is
  `0x1976a914{20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash}88ac` (
  `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`).
* otherwise `scriptCode` is `0x2576a820{32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash}88ac` (
  `OP_DUP OP_SHA256 <32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`).

### Consensus rule
To prevent the remote-staking node from spending funds in coinbase
transactions the following consensus rule is required:

> If a coinbase transaction contains an input with a remote-staking
  `scriptPubKey` then at least the same amount MUST be sent back to the same
  `scriptPubKey`.

Note that the reward does not have to be sent to the same script. This fact can
be used to add reward address to remote-staking node settings.

## Rationale
### SegWit vs non-SegWit
Alternatively remote staking can be implemented with the following script:

```
OP_PUSH_TXTYPE OP_1 OP_EQUAL OP_IF
  OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <20-byte-staking-pubkey-hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
  OP_DUP OP_SHA256 <32-byte-spending-pubkey-hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```

Where `OP_PUSH_TXTYPE` is a new opcode pushes the type of the transaction to the
stack; `OP_PUSH_TXTYPE OP_1 OP_EQUAL` checks if the transaction has type
`TxType::COINBASE`.

The segwit remote-staking program has the following advantages in comparison to
the non-segwit script:
* The segwit remote-staking program is much shorter than the non-segwit script.
* To enforce the aforementioned consensus rule, remote-staking scripts have to
  be distinguished from other types of scripts. The process of identifying of
  non-segwit remote-staking scripts is more involved.

The downside of the segwit version is that it seems to be less flexible. For
example, the else branch of the non-segwit remote-staking script can be changed
to P2SH but doing so with the segwit will require the introduction of a new
script version.

### 256-bit destination (SHA256 of a public key)
SHA256 of a public key is used to prevent the situation when users can receive
funds which are stakeable by someone else. Suppose the remote-staking script has
the following form:

```
1 <20-byte-staking-key-hash> <20-byte-spending-key-hash>
```

Where `<20-byte-spending-key-hash>` is a HASH160 of a public key, i.e. it
corresponds to an ordinary address.  Then the following situation might happen.
Alice asks Bob to send her 0.1 UTE. Instead of sending them directly Bob creates
a transaction with the following remote-staking `scriptPubKey`:

```
1 <Bob's address> <Alice's address>
```

This script allows Bob (and only Bob) to use the output as a stake. And it is
spendable only by Alice. As a result, Alice sees that she has received money but
she might not notice that she cannot stake them.

Why someone might want to do so:
1. To receive more rewards (this scenario could also be prevented by restricting
   reward addresses in coin-base transactions);
2. To acquire staking power in a cost-efficient way (for example to perform a
   51% attack).

256-bit destinations do not completely prevent this scenario but make it much
harder since they are not normally revealed.

## Use cases
The main use case is the following. Suppose Alice wants to securely stake her
UTEs. To do so she setups a remote-staking unit-e node (probably on some cheap
hardware like Raspberry Pi) which does not own any UTEs. Then she sends her
money to the following `scriptPubKey`:

```
1 <remote-staking nodes's 20-byte pubkey hash> <Alice's 32-byte pubkey hash>
```

After that Alice can shut down her wallet. The remote-staking node will use
these UTXOs as a stake when proposing a block and send rewards back to the same
`scriptPubKey`. Alice can spend the remote-stakeable UTXOs any time she wants.

Another use case is staking pools. But the description of staking pools is out
of the scope of this UIP.
